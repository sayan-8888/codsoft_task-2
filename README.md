## Code Explanation:-
The code is a Java program that calculates a student's total marks, average 
percentage, and final grade based on their scores in multiple subjects. 
The user inputs the number of subjects and the marks for each subject,
which are stored in an array. The total marks and average percentage are 
calculated. Based on the average percentage, the program assigns a grade:
'A' for 90% and above, 'B' for 80-89%, and so on down to 'F' for below 50%. 
The program then displays the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding
grade before closing the input scanner.
